Problem Statement

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.


Some of the steps performed:

    Data Understanding, Preparation, and Pre-Processing :
        Data understanding, identification of potentially useful and non-useful attributes and variable importance and impact estimation
        Data preparation, performing data cleaning, missing values imputation, outlier removal, and column level standardization (for e.g., date, etc.) into one format
         
    Exploratory Data Analysis :
        Performing basic preliminary data analysis including finding the correlation between variables and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables
        Performing advanced data analysis, including plotting relevant heatmaps, histograms, and basic clustering to find patterns in the data
         
    Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation :
        Feature engineering and performing one or more methods on attributes that can lead to the creation of a new potentially useful variable; for e.g., day from the date
        Variable transformation and applying categorical variable transformations to turn into numerical data and numerical variable transformations to scale data
         
    Model Selection, Model Building, and  Prediction :
        Identifying the type of problem and making a list of decisive models from all available choices
        Choosing a training mechanism; for e.g., cross-validation, etc., and tuning hyperparameters of each model
        Testing each model on the respective model evaluation metric
        Choosing the best model based on the fit of the data set and output variable
        Using ensemble options to improve the efficacy based on the evaluation metric stated in the problem
